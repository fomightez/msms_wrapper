*tl;dr:*  
Click any '`launch`' badge on this page to run msms_wrappter code inside your browser without installing anything on your own machine. 
On the remote machine, you'll need to install msms if you meet the license requirements.

JupyterLab:    
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fomightez/msms_wrapper/binderized?labpath=examples.ipynb)

#### ISSUES WITH THE LAUNCHED SESSION:

The `examples.ipynb` that opens doesn't have writeable permissions, even though I tried a lot to change the permissions in what GitHub has once I noticed it. The easy fix is to duplicate it and work from there.
